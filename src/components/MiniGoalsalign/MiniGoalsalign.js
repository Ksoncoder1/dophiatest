        Dophia works with smallholder farmers to
         plant high-value, multipurpose agroforestry
          trees (including fruit trees). By promoting 
          regenerative and climate-resilient food systems. 
          Soils play a critical role in carbon capture and storage.

            Therefore, improving the physical and biotic health of 
            soils, through agroforestry, contribute significantly 
            to climate adaptation. Resilient and healthy soils are 
            a precursor to improved productivity, hence food security 
            especially in Africa where over 50% of food consumed is 
            produced by smallholder farmers.

        Further, increased farm productivity leads to empowerment and 
        reducing poverty in communities that are reliant on agriculture.
